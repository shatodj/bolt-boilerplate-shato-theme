## How to run

1. Clone this project to your theme directory

1. Modify `build/webpack.config.js` to suit your needs

    ```js
    // your local website url, used by browser-sync as proxy
    const PROXY_URL = 'http://bolt3-webpack.com/';  

    // your template directory path, used by webpack as a root path when transform relative path to absolute path in css loader
    const TEMPLATE_PATH = '/theme/bolt-boilerplate-shato-theme/'; 
    ```

    // your template directory path, used as variable when you need to produce absolute path of your assets
    $TEMPLATE_URL : '/theme/bolt-boilerplate-shato-theme/';
    ```

1. Install project dependencies and build the theme

    ```
    # install project dependencies
    npm install 

    # build for development
    npm run dev

    # ..or build for production
    npm run build
    ```

1. Copy theme *content types* and *taxonomies* to `contenttypes.yml` and `taxonomies.yml`

    This theme is using own content types to distribute content between pages / templates. For this case 'sections' are used instead of 'blocks'. They contain more types of fields and can be mapped to different 'pages' or section groups. 'sectiongroup' taxonomy is used as mapping tool to the templates (record, entry, page, footer...).

    Section Content type:

    ```yml
    # 'Sections' Content Type
    # Sections are bigger blocks added on one or more pages / section groups mostly under the main content.
    # They should contain information about a particular page eg, listings of content, galleries...
    # Unlike blocks, sections are related to pages or content type templates (eg. recors, entries...)
    # so each section can be added to more places with no need to specifying in template itself.
    #
    # Since we cannot define own content types within theme, we must specify own content tyoe explicitely in contenttypes.yml.
    sections:
        name: Sections
        singular_name: Section

                label: "Related pages"
                format: "{{ item.title|escape }} (â„– {{ item.id }})"
                postfix: "By selecting a Content Block, you're creating a bi-directional relationship to that Content Block."
        taxonomy: [ sectiongroups ]
